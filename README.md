Project 3 - Java Quiz App: last project for Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics and the 3rd from 9 for course
Android Basics Nanodegree by Google

It's a java quiz. I choose to design a project with 2 activities: one for name input and the second for quiz questions.
I tried to implement a lot from the course topics and a little more knowledge from googleing. 

My project rubric was to implement all project specification and this extra requirements: 

1.	use loops in java code for processing the 3 types of questions so the java code to remain almost the same and will not be much bigger for a quiz with, lets say, 200 questions compared with one of 10 questions (this was the most challenging extra requirement);
2.	use of android:tag to find out programable from xml the type of the question (radio button, check button or edit text) and which is the correct answer;
3.	add an OK or NOT OK check mark image near each question after processing the Submit button;
4.	make toast message lasts longer than 3.5 sec., actually 7 seconds to have time to read the quiz results summary;
5.	use string buffer for concatenation strings in loops because they are much more efficient;
6.	add a warning message when Submit quiz and all questions have not an answer and wait confirmation to proceed or not;
7.	add a countdown counter for quiz time expired (10 minutes) with a toast message at Start quiz, another when one minute left and last when time expired;
8.	add a time counter for the duration of the quiz and display it in Quiz summary;
9.	a quiz summary include for each question correct/incorrect, all checked answers (given answers) and all correct answers;
10.	add a Send quiz button to send the quiz summary by email;
11.	use different layouts for landscape and portrait orientation;
12.	use the dimens.xml and styles.xml to lighten the layout code;
13.	localization for Romania (no hard coded strings!);
14.	make the keyboard disappear on opening activity for name input;
15.	save the state of second activity (including variables values) at orientation changes portrait/landscape;
16.	the code and all component files don’t have warningsș
17.	add my own icon launcher.
