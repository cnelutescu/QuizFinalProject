Project 3 - Java Quiz App: last project for Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics

It's a java quiz. I choose to design a project with 2 activities: one for name input and the second for quiz questions.
I tried to implement a lot from the course topics and a little more knowledge from googleing. 

My project rubric was to implement all project specification and this extra requirements: 

1. use loops in java code for processing the 3 types of questions so the java code to remain almost the same 
   and will not be much bigger for a quiz with, lets say, 200 questions compared with one of 10 questions
2. add an OK or NOT OK check mark image near each question after processing the Submit button;
3. make toast message lasts longer than 3.5 sec., actually 7 seconds to have time to read the quiz results summary;
4. use string buffer for concatenation strings in loops because they are much more efficient;
5. add a warning message when Submit quiz and all questions have not an answer and wait confirmation to proceed or not;
6. add a countdown counter for quiz time expired (10 minutes) with a toast message at Start quiz, another when one minute left
   and last when time expired;
7. add a time counter for the duration of the quiz and display it in Quiz summary;
8. Quiz summary include for each question correct/incorrect, all checked answers (given answers) and all correct answers;
9. add a Send quiz button to send the quiz summary by email;
10. use different layouts for landscape and portrait orientation; 
11. use the dimens.xml and styles.xml to lighten the layout code; 
12. localization for Romania (no hard coded strings!); 
13. make the keyboard disappear on opening activity for name input; 
14. save state of second activity (including variables values) at orientation changes portrait/landscape;
15. the code and all component files don't have warnings (even for typos).
